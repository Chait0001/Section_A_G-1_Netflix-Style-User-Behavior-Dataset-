# 📊 Netflix-Style User Behavior Analysis (OTT Sector)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes a Netflix-style OTT user behavior dataset to uncover actionable insights related to user engagement, churn, and revenue optimization.

The goal was to transform raw behavioral data into a strategic growth roadmap by linking demographics, device usage, content preferences, and subscription plans to financial outcomes.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Streaming platforms collect massive amounts of data but struggle to identify:

- Why users stay
- Why users churn
- Why premium tiers fail to convert
- Which content truly drives retention

Key Issues Identified:
- 14.5% inactive (churn) rate
- Premium+ contributes only ~9% revenue
- High session abandonment (~50%)
- Price–value mismatch in top-tier plan
